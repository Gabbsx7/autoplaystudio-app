<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana começou a transcrição</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   0:06
Let me start.
The record and the.
Yeah. OK. OK.</p>
<p>Taeke   0:13
OK.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   0:15
Hey.</p>
<p>Taeke   0:15
Shall I share my screen with you and I can walk you through the new screens?</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   0:18
OK.
OK, perfect.</p>
<p>Taeke   0:22
Or do you want to give me an update 1st and then we go through the new ones?</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   0:27
OK.
I have.
I have AI had a few, a few quick questions.
Right to to align the the the flow of the project OK.</p>
<p>Taeke   0:39
Mm hmm.
Mm hmm.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   0:45
OK so.
Yes, first you share a visual flow of the screens to. I know, I know, there&#x27;s no no finisher yet, but even would help me out. I get a better sense of the extruder.
You. Yeah, that I OK.</p>
<p>Taeke   1:06
So let me yeah I can.
I can walk you through the flow now and I can kinda give you the you know, the.
The idea of it.
So then so that it&#x27;s more clear for you?</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   1:20
Yes, yes, OK, it&#x27;s perfect.</p>
<p>Taeke   1:23
OK.
Let&#x27;s do it.
Should I share my screen or do you want to follow me on Figma?</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   1:35
You can share your screen.
OK, I see that.</p>
<p>Taeke   2:06
I&#x27;ll also just send you the link for follow. OK, perfect.
Hmm.
So.
Basically.
There are, you know, there are four, four people.
The studio admin.
The client admin.
The client member.
And studio member and these members are basically, you know employees or sub rolls of the clients in the studio.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   3:03
OK.</p>
<p>Taeke   3:04
So the studio is the is the owner of the whole thing. Basically has all of the the the, the rights and permissions.
Client admin is a subcategory and they have you know all the rights and permissions of their own of their own dashboard.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   3:20
It&#x27;s a perfect.</p>
<p>Taeke   3:26
But it&#x27;s so it&#x27;s basically, you know if we say OK, you know I am the studio admin.
Me.
Let&#x27;s say I sign up for for autoplay.
And I say I am a studio admin.
Then the idea would be that I get to.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   3:49
When you go I get.</p>
<p>Taeke   3:51
To my dashboard.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   3:51
It won&#x27;t.</p>
<p>Taeke   3:54
And that dashboard would have, you know, modules like the chat.
And the navigation and of course the top bar.
It would have to allow me to add team members.
Clients because I have clients.
So, for example molecule or you know?
End projects.
These that I have up there are basically filters and I thought you know that the we don&#x27;t have to focus on that right now, but it would be nice to kind of make like these dynamic filters.
I also can use this as a as an asset manager, you know with the with the folders.
And these playbooks I&#x27;m still working on that&#x27;s kind of like a collection of projects, but we don&#x27;t have to worry about that now.
And these project templates.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   4:53
OK, tell me about the the templates.</p>
<p>Taeke   4:57
Yeah. So if I were to say let&#x27;s say.
So let&#x27;s say.
This would be my screen.
You know, if I am so, I&#x27;m taka.
I&#x27;m a studio admin and I start up.
You know my.
I start up autoplay, you know, for the first time, I don&#x27;t have anything.
Then I have. I could say like, OK, if I want a new client I can say new client.
Let&#x27;s say it gives me a pop up.
So I say new client, it gives me a pop up with like. What is the name?
Who is it?
Bla bla bla bla, kinda what it is now.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   7:43
OK.</p>
<p>Taeke   7:45
And so then I would see.
I would go to molecule. If I say OK.
This client is called molecule.
None of those exist yet, right?</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   7:59
No.</p>
<p>Taeke   8:09
It would basically be completely completely empty.
And then I could say.
So this would be the the dashboard then that is for the client.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   8:41
This is the the 1st right.
The first dashboard.</p>
<p>Taeke   8:45
Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   8:46
On the first year access, OK.</p>
<p>Taeke   8:47
This is the clerk.
Yeah, exactly.
It&#x27;s a client dashboard.
So then from here I can say OK, I want to make a new project and then you go through the new project flow.
And that one I still have to make, but basically it would be.
You know, kind of like a proposal from draft to proposal like this.
Where you say the milestones.
And the tasks.
You know, like like this you say milestone?
One task does do and then.
For example.
Right. If I would say here now I click on project I wanna add a new project.
Then here it would say like, OK, you know what&#x27;s the project name?
What&#x27;s the category deadline budget? And it would make it there.
So I&#x27;d say, OK.
I want Marathon marathon video CVI production and then here I can say OK you know I can create milestones and in the milestones I can add tests.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   10:01
OK.
We model modelize the the futures in the project page.</p>
<p>Taeke   10:10
Yeah.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   10:11
OK, perfect.</p>
<p>Taeke   10:12
So all these things are basically, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to find is all these things are basically just, you know, modular blocks that the only thing that we should be doing is that the functionality, there&#x27;s a the highest level of functionality gives you all controls.
And. But basically what what we just do is we display the same features or the same modules just with less information depending on your role.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   10:45
OK, I understand. You understand. OK.</p>
<p>Taeke   10:49
And so, you know my my dashboard as a studio admin because I have full control over everything, you know, all the clients and all the projects and all collections.
Mine could be looking like this, you know, like OK.
Lots of clients, lots of projects, lots of collections.
But for a studio or a client admin?
You know, I am curating that dashboard for them because they&#x27;re my client.
So I might say, you know, these are the the projects that are now happening and these are the projects that I wanna feature for them.
And then for example, the client member might not even see.
All projects might only see the projects that are assigned to them in the chat.
Maybe they&#x27;re just assigned 1 project so they don&#x27;t even have to see the other ones.
Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   11:47
Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Taeke   11:49
No.
OK.
So basically, yeah, what I&#x27;m thinking.
And also if we if we do it like this as modules, I think for the mobile version it&#x27;ll be a lot easier to translate the screens.
OK.
So if we say no, we have the toolbar.
Or, you know, these are the the the the bars that will give you the the the main functionalities.
I still have to finalize that one.
I&#x27;m not sure.
Then we have modules and. Those are the things.
That kind of pop up or pop up, those are the things that are anchored to the left side or the right side. And then we have a canvas.
And so there&#x27;s basically, you know, one canvas where we say that is the navigator canvas and that always shows these cards.
In different sections.
No matter which dashboard it is, it just gives.
It&#x27;s the same structure, right?</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   13:06
Yes, this is a really good instructor.</p>
<p>Taeke   13:11
And then we would say.
You know this is the.
The.
So we have a navigator canvas and then we would say a creator canvas.
I don&#x27;t know what to call it, but you know something like that or an editor canvas.
And that&#x27;s basically.
You know that&#x27;s basically where you see the asset and where you can interact with the asset.
Yeah, it&#x27;d be fun to kind of brainstorm together how we would, how we would do the Figment integration.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   14:03
OK.
This is my this is my another question.</p>
<p>Taeke   14:08
Yeah.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   14:09
OK.
Let let me see, OK.
Could you define which core futurist you&#x27;d like to handle it? In the figure my integration you know.
So I can view them, for example aiding design blocks or or we can integrating with open AI API or?
The Gemini you know for generating images or videos, you know and the aggregating them into FEMA, you know this is this is be able.</p>
<p>Taeke   14:40
Yeah.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   14:47
Through the the the MCP.</p>
<p>Taeke   14:50
Yeah.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   14:51
Figure my MCP you know and we can see.</p>
<p>Taeke   14:53
Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   14:54
We can see this in in real time, in FEMA and in Autoplay app.</p>
<p>Taeke   15:01
Yeah, yeah.
So that was basically what I was thinking because the MCP, you know, as more of these apps will have MCPS. It&#x27;d be amazing if you have the autoplay and you can open figma from autoplay and then you immediately have your little MCP editor.
Like here.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   15:20
OK.</p>
<p>Taeke   15:22
And you, you know.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   15:24
Yes, we can insert the iframe of the the FEMA.</p>
<p>Taeke   15:28
Yeah.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   15:29
Yes.
I mean the the groups.</p>
<p>Taeke   15:34
But yeah, if you have. If you have better ideas for that.
You know, let me know.
Because I&#x27;m not sure yet what the best way to do it is. All I would all I know that for me as a user I think it&#x27;d be amazing &#x27;cause. Now if you want to use an MCP, you know, if you&#x27;re not a technical person, if you&#x27;re just.
A designer. You&#x27;re not gonna start, you know.
A local server or something like that, and so I feel like they&#x27;re not using MCPS.
So if this is an easy way to just open figma and you have an MCP.
Like that&#x27;s super easy.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   16:16
OK.
So we can start insert the the iframe of FEMA in the autoplay. OK and I I think.
The the chat you you have one agent of AI agent right?</p>
<p>Taeke   16:37
Mm hmm.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   16:37
And the user can talk with the agent and the agent send the the flow.
OK, to the FEMA and this translates translates the.</p>
<p>Taeke   16:48
Yeah.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   16:53
The assets and.
The.</p>
<p>Taeke   16:58
Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   16:59
You know, this is this makes sense.</p>
<p>Taeke   17:01
Yeah, that would be incredible.
Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   17:03
OK, OK.
Yeah, this, this this possible, right?</p>
<p>Taeke   17:15
So for the for the mobile screens, I basically just thought that it&#x27;s just a modules you know, but then stacked underneath each other.
Like that.
But maybe we don&#x27;t worry about that just now and for the for the cards.
Yeah, I thought these might be, you know, if you have a lot of cards that you can just kind of swipe through them.
Like this?</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   17:50
OK.
Yeah, as I build in the the coded component and I limit it to three cards, but this is flexible.</p>
<p>Taeke   17:55
Yeah.
Yeah. Nice.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   18:02
Hello.</p>
<p>Taeke   18:03
Really nice.
Yeah, I thought it. If we do it like this, I think it works really well as a you know for, for, for on mobile too.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   18:15
I starting mobile first.
You know to to give the more of faster development, you know, and the I I sync to the.</p>
<p>Taeke   18:17
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   18:28
The screens you know.</p>
<p>Taeke   18:30
Mm hmm.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   18:35
OK.</p>
<p>Taeke   18:46
I still have to. OK, so maybe we can go through these modules.
Let&#x27;s go through the so I thought the chat module.
Basically, the chat with your team members is just like a module and it&#x27;s just completely contained in that in that block.
So we can just, you know, you can you turn it on or turn it off.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   19:08
OK.</p>
<p>Taeke   19:10
And I thought we would keep it.
You know simple.
So for example, you just start off with.
You know, it could be just like that minimized first and if you click on it, it would expand.
It just shows you your notifications.
Maybe it just shows you one you know, and this could just be if you this could just slide down, right? This is just scrollable.
It shows you the clients or if you are the client it shows you your own your own team.
And then it shows you your projects, marathon project, Footlocker, project design project, whatever.
And then it shows you your team.
So if I would go OK notifications I see here directly. You know Joe, to send me something.
If I would go to click on this, I would just go to a group chat of all the people who are in molecule. If I go in the marathon project chat, I just go to this one which is the comments for the projects and if I go here.
Then I can do a direct message to a team member.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   20:47
And.
You like studio Adamin or the studio member? You can able to send.
The chat message you enter in the client dashboard and you access the chat.
Through the client dashboard, this is the the flow.</p>
<p>Taeke   21:11
Yeah.
Yeah. Well, I think the the the chat is just.
For example, we could say that.
So the the chat is just on the.
On the main dashboard, so it&#x27;s always on the dashboard. It&#x27;s also on the client dashboard.
And on the studio dashboard. But on the studio dashboard, it would just have more. You know, for example, as a studio, I&#x27;m looking as a studio admin.
You know, this might be, yeah.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   21:56
Yes, OK.</p>
<p>Taeke   21:57
Multiple clients.
But as you know, those are because those are just a group chat basically.
And as those client.
Know what I mean?
So basically just changes based on what page you are and if you&#x27;re no.
But I can work this out in better better screens if you&#x27;d like.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   22:36
OK.</p>
<p>Taeke   22:38
But basically it should just work like like a a slack, but like a minimize slack you know not not and it just works in the same.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   22:38
Well.</p>
<p>Taeke   22:47
Block so you you click on something and if you wanna go back you just click back and then you go to the previous page and you can go deeper and deeper into it.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   22:57
Yes, this is this is good.
This is good, OK.
In the shadow it will support tagging members and the milestones and the projects, right?</p>
<p>Taeke   23:11
Yeah, exactly.
Because there should be a way for example like this one. You know if if I say hey, could you please help me with you know project Marathon, milestone one and task 2 then we we don&#x27;t maybe not need to link the tasks maybe just a milestones in the.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   23:13
OK.</p>
<p>Taeke   23:30
Projects and the people because.
That that would be, you know ideal because then I can just click on this and I go to that project, right.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   23:41
Yes, this makes.</p>
<p>Taeke   23:41
So it&#x27;d be really, yeah.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   23:48
OK and.
About the heuristic eue engine, you know you you already have some rules in mind for what should be be shown on on screen.</p>
<p>Taeke   24:00
Yeah.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   24:03
You know if if you&#x27;re open to share them with me, there will be super helpful. So I can start shaping the algorithm.</p>
<p>Taeke   24:06
Yeah.
Yeah.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   24:11
You know, in the real screen.</p>
<p>Taeke   24:11
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, exactly.
So for example, you know with the milestone module like for me I would see it this way. You know with a little maybe with a little delete icon and that kind of stuff.
The client admin.
Might also see like this if I say like hey, I want you to get you know full access.
Or they cannot delete.
You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   24:50
Yes, OK.</p>
<p>Taeke   24:52
And then there is.
A.
And they might not be able to to click on this at all.
So that is just a a very simple simple example of certain things being shown and not being shown.
But I will make those rules and and and make those screens.
Yeah. And this one is, you know the for the new product and the project templates.
Basically, you know, if you do a new project.
And you go through all the the the steps and creating the milestones and creating the the questions. Then you already have a template only this one is specific to a client and so sometimes client makes their own or I make one for the client, right.
Right. And so there should also be a way to say, OK.
You know, I really like this project or I&#x27;m going to make this project as a template and then you just say save as a template and then you put it on the dashboard.
But I also make this as a better better screen.
But does this kind of make sense now?
A little bit better.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   26:22
Yes, yes. Perfect.
Yeah, this is the perfect time.
OK.
All right, so we can move forward, but on the agenda and I will start building accord to what we&#x27;re defining here.
What do you mean?</p>
<p>Taeke   26:37
Yeah.
Perfect. I&#x27;m gonna continue on those screens and get them to you as soon as possible. And then I&#x27;ll also maybe we can do that together.
Sometime next week where I&#x27;ll make you know certain.
Personas and how they would go through it and then we can start thinking about because then we can also test it better to see if everything works the way that we that we think it should.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   26:59
Yes.
Yes, this is perfect.
This is perfect timing line and no worries. OK we can.</p>
<p>Taeke   27:10
OK.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   27:16
Building after.
You you enter the the screens and the icing to construct and build in the back end to create the the base of the the project.</p>
<p>Taeke   27:33
I think I mean I I can imagine that for the back end also the chat with those those anchors or what do you call like milestones and being able to address people?
That one is really important, I think, right?
Because if I&#x27;m just thinking of, how would how would you know?
How would I use this if I&#x27;m if I&#x27;m using it as a studio admin? You know this should be a solution for me.
You know, if I&#x27;m an owner of a small.
Studio and I have a couple clients I need to be able to communicate with them.
I need to be able to communicate with my team members.
I need to create projects and assign projects and and that&#x27;s basically the main thing and I need to be able to see the assets.
So that I think that&#x27;s the whole kind of and we&#x27;re trying to make it as simple as possible.
I really try to make each screen you know as soon as it feels too cluttered.
I think we gonna have to take a step back and think, OK, how can we?
How can we minimize this?</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   28:39
Yes. Yeah. Look is this is UX flow.
This is easily to the the user OK to.</p>
<p>Taeke   28:48
Yeah.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   28:49
Yeah, you know. But yeah, this makes sense.
A lot of sense right now.</p>
<p>Taeke   28:54
OK.
Great. Great. OK.
I&#x27;ll continue working on those screens and I&#x27;ll let you know as soon as I have them.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   29:03
OK, tiger.
Thank you for the your time and we got started.</p>
<p>Taeke   29:08
Yeah. Perfect.
Let&#x27;s connect soon.
I&#x27;ll let you know.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   29:11
OK, I send you a message and we can organize.
The the lately call, OK.</p>
<p>Taeke   29:19
Yeah.
Yeah, perfect. OK, bye. Bye.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   29:21
Perfect. Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p>Taeke   29:23
Have a great day.</p>
<p>Gabriel Henrique  Santos Santana   29:23
Have a nice weather to chat.</p>
